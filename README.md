Security management in public spaces and private facilities often faces significant challenges in detecting potential threats in real-time. Traditional surveillance systems rely heavily on human operators, leading to delays and errors in identifying dangerous objects such as weapons. Weapon detection in Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage is crucial for enhancing security and preventing criminal activities. Current systems do not offer the automation needed to promptly detect and alert authorities or security personnel when a weapon is visible on CCTV footage. Moreover, manual review of security footage can be time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to overlooking critical details.
This project work proposes weapon detection using Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. Deep Learning algorithms are used to detect the weapon accurately with the goal to reduce crimes and increase safety and security. This focuses on developing a real-time weapon detection system using advanced You Only Look Once (YOLOv9) version. The system is designed to automatically detect various weapons, including knifes and rifles and other potential threats.
This project work aims to implement a real-time weapon detection system using YOLOv9 for CCTV footage analysis. The system captures live camera feed, processes the frames to detect specific weapons such as Knife, Rifle, and others, using the YOLOv9 object detection model trained on a custom dataset. Upon detecting a weapon, the system triggers an email alert to notify the user and simultaneously plays a buzzer sound for immediate attention. The backend is developed in Python, utilizing OpenCV for real-time video capture, and “smtplib” for sending email alerts. The frontend interface is built using “Streamlit”, allowing users to interact with the system, monitor the video feed, and receive real-time notifications. This project work enhances security surveillance systems by providing automatic weapon detection and alert mechanisms, offering a proactive approach to security management.
